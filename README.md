This assignment is to:
---
1. Set up "slist.h" such that each function will work as intended
2. The database has 13,000 airports, so the linked list should be as efficient as possible.
3. Use this to allow main to work. Main should input a file "USAirportCodes.csv" and convert it to a linked list. 
4. Sort the linked list by distance from Austin.
5. The output of main should be whichever airport is farthest from Austin (AUS). Use longitude and latitude
6. The output should also include a sublist of all airports within 10km of Austin
